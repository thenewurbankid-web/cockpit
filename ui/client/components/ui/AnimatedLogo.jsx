// The brand mark, alive (#455). Owner request, 2026-09-21: "make the logos active always with subtle
// animation". Same API as `Logo` (`mark`, `size`, `className`) so it is a drop-in at every call site.
//
// WHY NO ANIMATION LIBRARY (owner decision, 2026-09-21 — free/open technology first)
// The four marks are pills, a bar and a circle. A travelling stroke-dash gap and a scale/opacity breathe
// cover the whole brief in CSS keyframes (app/brand.css), so we add **0 KB** to the bundle, need no
// runtime download, work offline on loopback, and make no network call of any kind. `motion` (MIT) was
// the next option had a real engine been needed; Lottie after that (its JSON is at least an open text
// format we could generate deterministically); Rive last and rejected — a `.riv` is a binary only its
// proprietary editor can author, and we cannot run that editor here.
//
// THE ENGINE IS STILL SWAPPABLE. This component owns only the *motion state* and publishes it on a
// wrapper element as `data-motion` ("off" | "idle" | "paused" | "busy" | "exit"). The stylesheet is one
// consumer of that state; a future Lottie/Rive/canvas engine is another, and would read the same
// attribute without any call site changing. That is the whole interface.
//
// GUARDRAILS (both of these matter on the hosted box, where a Cockpit tab stays open all day):
//   - `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` -> "off": no loop at all, not a shortened one. `busy` follows
//     the same rule (below); `exit` is the one deliberate exception — see `exiting` below.
//   - tab hidden, or the mark scrolled out of view -> "paused": the compositor stops, no CPU burnt
//     animating something nobody can see.
//
// #406 adds two more states, both requested by a caller rather than computed from visibility:
//   - `busy` (prop): a faster loop of the SAME per-mark keyframes idle already uses — read by
//     components/ui/AnimatedLoader.jsx so a loading indicator is built from the same marks/tokens
//     instead of a parallel spinner. Still gated by reduced motion (falls back to "off"), same as idle.
//   - `exiting` (prop) -> "exit": a short, one-shot hand-off animation (brand.css), used by the login
//     screen (#406) right before the Cockpit itself replaces it, so the cut is a resolve rather than a
//     jump. Unlike `busy`, this is published EVEN under reduced motion: `onExitEnd` is a completion
//     signal a caller uses to know when it is safe to unmount, and that has to fire deterministically
//     whether or not an animation actually played — the stylesheet's own reduced-motion rule
//     (`.brand-mark, .brand-mark * { animation: none !important }`) still guarantees nothing is seen
//     to move; this component additionally fires `onExitEnd` on the very next tick instead of waiting
//     for an `animationend` that would never come.
//
// Accessibility is unchanged from `Logo`: the wrapper is `aria-hidden` decoration beside the real text
// label ("Cockpit"), it is not focusable, and it adds no accessible name of its own.
