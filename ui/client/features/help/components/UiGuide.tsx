      <h3>The Cockpit layout</h3>
      <p>
        Every screen sits in the same frame: the <strong>Browser</strong> on the left (find things), the{' '}
        <strong>stage</strong> in the middle (the screen itself), and <strong>Tools</strong> on the right
        (inspect, edit, check). A screen&apos;s own tabs come first in the Browser. The menu down the left edge has
        the five screens (<strong>Features, Pages, Components, Git, Tests</strong>); collapse it to icons with
        the arrow at its foot. The top bar has the project switcher, the search box and the profile menu, which holds Settings, Local model, the theme (Dark, Light or System), Help and
        Sign out.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Command palette</strong> — press <code>Ctrl K</code> (<code>Cmd K</code> on a Mac) to reach
          any screen or action by typing a few letters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Drawer</strong> — <code>Ctrl J</code> opens the bottom drawer: <em>Diagnostics</em> (what{' '}
          <code>construct validate</code> found, with file and line), <em>Logs</em> and <em>Processes</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Panes</strong> — <code>Ctrl B</code> shows or hides the Browser, <code>Ctrl Alt B</code> the
          Tools panel; drag a divider or use the arrow keys on it to resize. On a narrow window one pane shows
          at a time, switched from the bar at the bottom.

      <h3>Pages Editor</h3>
      <p>
        Pick a feature and a page in the Browser to see its elements as a tree. Frame your running app in{' '}
        <strong>Live app preview</strong> and click an element to jump to its code. In Tools: <em>Inspector</em>{' '}
        (edit the selected element), <em>Scope</em> (how the page&apos;s values flow into a component),{' '}
        <em>Source</em> (the whole file, with type errors marked) and <em>Diff</em> (what changed on disk
        outside the editor). Every save is previewed and checked against your architecture rules first.
      </p>
      <h3>Workflows</h3>
      <p>
        Pick a workflow file to see its diagram. Tools: <em>Narrative</em> (the flow in plain English, every
        start-to-end scenario, and a health check), <em>Context &amp; actions</em> and <em>Edit</em> (both
        preview a diff before anything is written).

      <h3>Features: stage actions</h3>
      <p>The stage of Features has four actions, one per capability (they were the Dashboard&apos;s forms). Choose one to open its form; each has its own result panel.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Create</strong> — scaffold a new feature (all 7 layer folders), a vertical slice
          (several layers of one logical unit, built in dependency order), or a single layer file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Refactor</strong> — move a file to a different layer, or rename it within the
          same layer. Mechanical and LLM-free.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Research</strong> — read-only. &quot;Doctor&quot; checks your environment/tooling;
          &quot;Summarize&quot; produces an English or JSON/Markdown summary of one feature (or the whole
          project).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Import (non-interactive)</strong> — for a single already-known old file or an
          already-approved plan file. For the guided, chat-style whole-route flow, use the Import
          Wizard page instead.

      <h3>Settings</h3>
      <p>
        Applied to every command run from this UI — nothing is persisted to disk, so restarting the
        backend resets them to their defaults:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Project directory</strong> — the project every command works on, exactly like the CLI&apos;s{' '}
          <code>--dir</code> flag. Type a path or use the folder browser; the project switcher in the top bar
          changes it too.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>LLM provider, per capability</strong> — one choice each for Import fill, Create/generate fill
          and Plan analysis. &quot;none&quot; keeps that step off unless a command opts in; a local model is
          offered for the two fill steps but never for Plan analysis.
        </li>

      <h3>Import Wizard</h3>
      <p>
        A chat-style, guided version of <code>construct import --route</code>: seed it with a route
        (optional), start the session, and answer its questions as they arrive in the chat. Log
        lines stream in the instant they happen — not batched at the end — and its one analysis LLM
        call is shown as its own attribution bubble, same tool/llm split as everywhere else. Each
        browser tab (WebSocket connection) runs its own independent session — log capture is scoped
        per session, so concurrent sessions never cross-talk.
