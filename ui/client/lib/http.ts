// #278: `credentials: 'include'` on every call. The session cookie is set
// by ui/server on :4000 and the Cockpit is served from :3000 — a different
// origin — so without this the browser sends no cookie and every request
// from a signed-in user comes back 401. It belongs here, once, rather than
// in each feature's service/ layer: a feature that forgot it would look
// logged out for no discoverable reason.
