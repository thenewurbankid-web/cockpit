// #312/#313/#351 -- runs ONE analysis in a forked child process (reviewWorker.mjs), so the synchronous
// PR-health engine can never stall the Cockpit server's request thread.
//
// It can be stopped: an AbortSignal (the process engine's cancel, #287) or the timeout ends the child the
// way the worker was designed to be ended. SIGTERM first, because the worker's temporary `git worktree`
// checkouts are removed by its own SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP handler (src/engine/gitTrees.mjs). That handler
// only runs when the worker's synchronous stretch returns (the engine uses spawnSync), so after a grace
// period the child is SIGKILLed, and whatever it could not clean up is reclaimed HERE, deterministically
// and only for that child's pid (`reclaimTreesOf`). Either way, when the returned promise settles, no
// worktree registration and no `construct-prhealth-<pid>-*` directory of that child is left.
