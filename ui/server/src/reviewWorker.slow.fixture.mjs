// Test fixture only (#351): a review worker that holds its temporary checkouts open, so a test can cancel an
// analysis while `git worktree` registrations and a `construct-prhealth-<pid>-*` directory really exist.
//
// It does exactly what the real worker does to get them (`withTrees`), then blocks in a synchronous wait,
// like the real engine does inside `spawnSync`, so a SIGTERM's handler cannot run until the wait ends: the
// parent has to SIGKILL and reclaim. It writes `{pid, dirs}` to the file named by OG351_MARKER (synchronously,
// so the test can see the checkouts exist before it cancels).
